/**
 * Logistic Regression (aka logit, MaxEnt) classifier.
 *
 *
 * Logistic regression is named for the function used at the core of the method, the logistic function.
 * The logistic function, also called the sigmoid function was developed by statisticians to describe properties of
 * population growth in ecology, rising quickly and maxing out at the carrying capacity of the environment.
 * Itâ€™s an S-shaped curve that can take any real-valued number and map it into a value between 0 and 1,
 * but never exactly at those limits.
 *
 * 1 / (1 + e^-value)
 *
 * @example
 * import { LogisticRegression } from 'machinelearn/linear_model';
 * import { HeartDisease } from 'machinelearn/datasets';
 *
 * (async function() {
 *   const { data, targets } = await heartDisease.load();
 *   const { xTest, xTrain, yTest } = train_test_split(data, targets);
 *
 *   const lr = new LogisticRegression();
 *   lr.fit(xTrain, yTrain);
 *
 *   lr.predict(yTest);
 * });
