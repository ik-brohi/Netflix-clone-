/**
 * This dataset contains information collected by the U.S Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston Mass.
 * It was obtained from the StatLib archive (http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston),
 * and has been used extensively throughout the literature to benchmark algorithms.
 * However, these comparisons were primarily done outside of Delve and are thus somewhat suspect.
 * The dataset is small in size with only 506 cases.
 *
 * The data was originally published by Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L.
 * `Hedonic prices and the demand for clean air', J. Environ. Economics & Management, vol.5, 81-102, 1978.
